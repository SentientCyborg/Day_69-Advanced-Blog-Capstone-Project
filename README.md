# Day_69-Advanced-Blog-Capstone-Project
This is the Capstone project for Day 69 of 100 Days of Code.

The project starts with a partially developed blog website and it is my job to finish the blog so that users can be added. I decided to upload the starting files and update this repo 
as I make progress. The goal is to finish the project and to learn more about using Git.

The starting files for this project came from Day 69 of the Udemy course [100 Days of Code by Dr. Angela Yu]
(https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).
