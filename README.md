# Day_69-Advanced-Blog-Capstone-Project
This is the Capstone project for Day 69 of 100 Days of Code.

The project started with a partially developed blog website and the goal was to finish
per the instructors directions. I also used this as an opportunity to practice Git. The
project currently meets all of the instructor's requirements

For this server, the first user created is the Admin. This was per the directions, but it
was not my preference. Only the admin can create and delete posts. Regular users can only
add comments.

If I were to improve upon this project, I would add functionality for regular users to
be able to update their passwords and delete comments. The admin also needs the ability
to delete comments and possibly ban users. The registration form needs better validation 
to check for existing users and there should probably be some sort of special character 
enforcement on passwords.

The starting files for this project came from Day 69 of the Udemy course [100 Days of Code by Dr. Angela Yu]
(https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).
